## 📄 Document Structure

This roadmap was reorganized in November 2025 (v2.0) from a single large file into a multi-file structure for better organization and navigation. The original roadmap remains available at `docs/roadmap.md` for reference.

**Why the change?**
- Easier navigation (find items quickly)
- Better focus (active work separated from history)
- Multiple audiences (devs, PMs, stakeholders see relevant sections)
- More scalable (add new files as needed)
- Less duplication (one source of truth per section)
